1.3	Objectives of the Study
	The main aim of the study is to develop a model for population forecasting in Nigeria. Specific objectives are:
i.	To extract the features of existing population census from the last census conducted back in 2006.
ii.	To Design a population forecasting system using natural fund growth rate model and algorithm.
iii.	To implement the design of population forecasting system.
iv. To evaluate the performance of the system in (iii) above.


1.4.  Methodology

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - Gather historical population data from reliable sources, such as census data, government reports, or statistical databases.
   - Collect relevant demographic variables, including birth rates, death rates, migration data, socioeconomic factors, and any other factors that influence population dynamics
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Conduct EDA to understand the patterns, trends, and relationships within the population data and demographic variables.
 3.  Feature Engineering:
   - Derive additional features that could enhance the forecasting model's performance, such as population density, economic indicators, urbanization rates, or healthcare access measures.
   - Derive additional features that could enhance the forecasting model's performance, such as population density, economic indicators, urbanization rates, or healthcare access measures.
   - Perform feature selection techniques to identify the most influential variables for population forecasting.

4. Model Development and Training: - Split the historical data into training and validation sets, ensuring a sufficient time period for validation.
5. Model Deployment and Visualization:
   -Using python to Implement the population forecasting model into a user-friendly software tool or web application.
